# Proxytool for Guilded
Utility for proxying messages through webhooks for varying avatars and usernames. Inspired by Pluralkit.


## Current Plan
This repo currently exists for me to manage features before actually publishing the code in something resembling usability.
I'll publish the code when I've got it to an acceptable level of basic features.
